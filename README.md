# 📊 Crime Against Women – Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📄 Project Description

This project analyzes crime data related to women across different states and time periods in India. The goal is to identify key patterns, trends, and hotspots to help raise awareness and support data-driven solutions for women’s safety.

Using tools like **Python**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Power BI**, the project performs data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visual representation of crime statistics. An interactive Power BI dashboard highlights major crime types including **rape**, **domestic violence**, **dowry deaths**, and **abduction**.
